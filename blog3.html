            <h2 class="Subheading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Hello everyone, and welcome to this blog. Today, I'm going to provide a comprehensive guide on securing research internships outside India. Whether you're in your freshman year or in your third year, this guide will be beneficial for you. You might wonder why you should listen to me. Well, I've been through the rigorous process of applying to numerous research programs, getting accepted to some and rejected from many. I have previously worked at remarkable places like the University of Birmingham (Summer 2022) and am looking forward to opportunities at Aalto University and Stanford University (both in Summer 2023). I understand how exhausting and challenging this journey can be, and sometimes students may feel lost. Therefore, in this blog, I'll share my experiences and tips, so please stick with me until the end, and I promise you'll find this blog useful(I have also added some <b>pro tips</b>, so keep an eye out for those!)
                <br><br>
                Firstly, why should you consider research internships? My personal motivation stemmed from my love for solving real-life problems and making substantial contributions. Research projects provided me with the intellectual stimulation I craved. If you're in your early college years, I recommend trying it out. Research internships can enhance your profile for placements and graduate school, provide valuable experiences, and often, they're enjoyable and offer international exposure – plus, you get to travel to a new country!
                <br><br>
                When seeking research opportunities, you generally have two options: applying to summer programs or independent research programs at different universities, which is relatively straightforward and typically includes funding; or the more complex route of cold emailing professors to request working under their guidance, where funding is not guaranteed, but you may find external funding sources. This blog will focus primarily on the former, but many insights about statements of purpose, recommendation letters, and more are applicable to both approaches.
                <h2 class="Subheading">Step 1 - Choosing a Program:</h2>
            <p>
                As an Indian student, some programs may not be open to you, but there are still many that accept a significant number of Indian students. I will attach a <a href="https://github.com/himahuja/Research-Internships-for-Undergraduates"target="_blank">GitHub</a> repository containing an exhaustive list of programs available to Indians. Once you've identified the programs you're interested in, visit their websites, review the projects listed, and select those that align with your previous research experience and interests. If you have a specific niche interest, you might face less competition and have better chances of acceptance.
                <br><br>
                What if you lack research experience? This is common, and it doesn't mean you're without chances. You'll just need to tailor your statement of purpose accordingly, which I'll discuss in upcoming sections.

            <h2 class="Subheading">Step 2 - Preparing your Resume:</h2>
            People suggest various formats, but I prefer simplicity. Here are my tips:
            <ol>
                <li>Create your resume in LaTeX. It might be a bit of a hassle, but it results in a polished look and demonstrates effort. You can use <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs"target="_blank">Jake's</a> widely used LaTeX template or contact me at <a href="mailto:vedantzope@gmail.com"target="_blank">vedantzope@gmail.com</a> for the custom template I use.</li>
                <li>Organize your resume so that the most important information appears first: start with education, followed by experiences or projects, then coursework, and finally skills and extracurricular activities.</li>
                <li>When describing a project, use three bullet points: first, what the problem was; second, your solution; and third, the final results.</li>
                <li>Include skills and tools relevant to the project you're applying for.</li>
                <li>Ensure no spelling errors, and minimize white space – no one likes an empty-looking resume.</li>
                <li>Include your GitHub profile link, and your website link (if you have one).</li>
                <li><b>Pro tip:</b> Place quantifiable figures on the left. The human brain tends to lose focus over time, so impactful numbers should be at the beginning. Imagine a big "F" over your resume – people generally focus on everything below the F during a quick glance, so place impactful content there to encourage thorough reading.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2 class="Subheading">Step 3 - Drafting the Cover Letter/Statement of Purpose:</h2>
            <p>
                This is the most crucial part of your application. It's your chance to showcase your personality, your passion, and your skills. It's your chance to stand out from the crowd. Here are my tips:

                Your statement of purpose (SOP) should be compelling and address these three critical questions:
                <ol>
                    <li>Who are you?</li>
                    <li>Why are you interested in this program?</li>
                    <li>Why should they select you?</li>
                </ol>
                In addition to answering these questions, your SOP should highlight your motivation to complete the project, your collaborative skills, soft skills, and writing skills (important for reports and papers). A well-structured SOP can significantly enhance your application. Here's a general structure you can follow:
                <ol>
                    <li>Paragraph 1: Introduce yourself, your field of study, and your brief research interests.</li>
                    <li>Paragraph 2: Explain your motivation for taking up the project and your interest in this particular project topic.</li>
                    <li>Paragraph 3: Describe your previous research experience, if any, and how it relates to the project you're applying for.</li>
                    <li>Paragraph 4/5: Highlight your skills and qualifications. If you don't have research experience, talk about your MOOCs, courses, or course projects and how they've shaped your understanding of the topic. If you have relevant experience, discuss it in detail, explaining how it aligns with this project and how you can apply your previous learning here. This section is your chance to delve deep, share your story, and discuss the technical aspects and intricate details of your projects.</li>
                    <li>Paragraph 6: Mention your extracurricular activities or a collaborative project, showcasing your teamwork skills and your ability to communicate effectively and tackle challenges.</li>
                    <li>Paragraph 7: Conclude by reiterating your desire to work on the project, describe your future goals and how this program will help you achieve them, mention any special circumstances (if there) and finally, thank the professor for considering your application.</li>
                </ol>
                Remember, it’s essential not to submit the same SOP for every program. If you're applying to multiple programs, create a master SOP and then tailor it to each program. This will save you time and effort.
            <h2 class="Subheading">Step 4 - Requesting Recommendation Letters:</h2>
            Most research programs will ask for one or two recommendation letters as part of your application. The selection of your recommenders is crucial. Ideally, you should ask professors who know you really well and can vouch for your capabilities, especially those who have seen you work in a research setting, preferably in the same domain. If you don't have any prior research experience, you can request letters from professors who have taught you subjects related to the project's topic. For example, if you're applying to a project in machine learning, a professor who taught you machine learning, linear algebra, or calculus would be suitable. In the case of needing two recommendation letters, it's best to have one from an academic course supervisor and another from a research project advisor. This approach provides a holistic view of your profile, showcasing both your academic and practical research skills.
            <br><br>
            Once you've identified your recommenders, send them an email requesting a letter. It's best to do this at least a month before the deadline. In your email, include your resume, SOP, and a brief description of the project you're applying for. This will help your recommender write a more personalized letter. If you're applying to multiple programs, you can send your recommenders a list of all the programs you're applying to, along with their deadlines. This will help them plan their time accordingly. If you're applying to a program that requires two recommendation letters, you can send the same email to both recommenders, but it's best to send separate emails to each recommender if you're applying to multiple programs.
            <h2 class="Subheading">Step 5 - Submitting your Application:</h2>
            Now that you have all the required materials ready – a polished resume, a compelling statement of purpose, and strong recommendation letters – the next step is to fill out and submit the application form. Pay close attention to the details in the application process. Some forms might ask for additional information or require you to answer specific prompts. These might seem minor, but they are integral parts of your application and should be approached with the same level of care and attention as the other components.
            <br><br>
            Once you have submitted your application, the most challenging part begins – the wait. It's natural to feel anxious about the outcome, but it's important to shift your focus away from worrying about whether you got in. Constantly stressing over the results won't change the outcome and can be mentally exhausting. Instead, use this time to engage in other productive activities or start planning for other opportunities. Stay confident in the work you've put into your application. Remember, you've done your best, and now it's out of your hands. Good things often take time, so be patient and keep a positive mindset.
            <h2 class="Subheading">Step 6 - Preparing for the Interview:</h2>
            Just revise your resume and SOP, and you'll be good to go. if there are any concepts that you have talked about in your projects, then it is also a good idea to go through them before your interview.
            <br><br>
            <b>Pro Tip:</b> Consider creating a presentation deck about your work, including images from previous projects, relevant courses, and key projects you've worked on. If you have a good understanding of the prospective project, you can also add a slide or two outlining potential approaches for tackling the project. This approach not only helps you explain your work more effectively but also impresses interviewers. It demonstrates the effort and dedication you're willing to invest. I personally used this method, and it made a significant impact – my interviewer was very impressed. This strategy showcases not just your achievements but also your proactive approach and commitment.
